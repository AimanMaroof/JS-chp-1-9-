// QS.1 --> Combine parentheses and the modulus operator % to first calculate the remainder of 20 % 6 before performing the other arithmetic operations. What is the value of calculation?
let calculation = (20 % 6) + 4 * 2;
alert("The value of calculation is : " + calculation);


// QS.2 --> Write an expression that calculates (6 + 2) * (5 - 3), and determine the value of expressionValue.
let expressionValue = (6 + 2) * (5 - 3);
alert("The expressionValue is : " + expressionValue);


// QS.3 -->  What is the value of finalTotal in the following expression, 5 + 3 * 2 - 8 / 4 and how does operator precedence apply here?
let finalTotal = 5 + 3 * 2 - 8 / 4;
alert("The finalTotal is : " + finalTotal);



// QS.4 --> Evaluate the value of answer and determine how JavaScript processes the following expression: (10 - 4) * (6 + 2) / 4
let answer = (10 - 4) * (6 + 2) / 4;
alert("the answer is : " + answer);
